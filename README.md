# Receipt3.0

## Overview
For our Hack the North 2022 submission, the rise of Web3 lead us to explore a new topic in web development that all of us were unfamiliar with. We created Receipt3.0, a full-stack application that allows businesses to create digital receipts that exist on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The idea of the project focused on decentralization, where individuals had ownership of their own receipts, and can use it to refund their bought products. These receipt tokens would exist on the user's MetaMask wallet. We built smart contracts using Solidity and tested everything on the Ganache network. The frontend was created using React and Chakra-UI, while the backend used Express, Node, and MongoDB to store data.
